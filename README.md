# QuietQuestions

QuietQuestions is a Django application made to give users a platform for asking and responding to questions anonymously.

The application is built to be completely private and does not collect any personal information from users or access their browser data. The goal is making QuietQuestions a positive place online in a sea of predatory applications that are constantly trying to collect and monetize users data.

Additionally, this site stands apart from Reddit and other similar applications by lacking any form of free text or direct communication between users. This was an intentional design choice that is meant to create a streamlined experience for users by preventing unsolicited or irrelevant comments from ending up in their results.

QuietQuestions is free to use and free from ads.
